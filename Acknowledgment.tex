\chapter*{Acknowledgment}
\quad\ I couldn't have done all this work by myself. I have to thank many people for their contribution in this work.\\


First, I would also like to thank Koen Hilleweart, my master’s thesis promoter, that proposed to perform a weekly meeting to see the work advancement and to give his thought about the content to explore in this work.

I sincerely thank all my family for their huge support during all my studies. In particular, they help me to go through the Covid-19 crisis that was a big obstacle to overcome.

Special thank to Medhi Rouabah and Andres Giraldo from MITIS that involved me to the construction of the test bench. The time working with them was really valuable.

I also want to thank all the people from the thermodynamic Laboratory of the ULiège who gave me access to their infrastructure and tools.

Last but not least, huge thank to my internship supervisor Michel Delanaye, the CEO of MITIS. He gave me advice and criticism to improve my work. He gave me the opportunity to do my internship within MITIS and to learn what the work in a team was. He also provided to me the access to all their resources. The internship without him as supervisors would have not been the same. I thank you again.

Once again, thank to all of you!
