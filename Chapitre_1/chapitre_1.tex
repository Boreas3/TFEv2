\quad\, Since the end of the 17th century, people have started to study the conversion of the thermal energy into work. The purpose was to utilize the available raw energy to produce works.

Denis Papin, a French person born in 1647 in the region of Chitenay, developed one of the first conversion machines in 1690. The machine, a steam piston engine, was powered by steam which produced a back and forth movement of the piston head generating power.

Then, later in the 18th century, the British James Watt (1736 - 1819) invented and commercialized a steam machine. Thanks to the great marketing around his product, the machine was very successful among the merchants. Indeed, at this time many machines were powered by horses.\\

James Watt saw this as an opportunity by creating a unit to compare its machines to the horses. The name of the unit was the horse power. Later the power will be expressed in Watt (W) in tribute to James Watt. One of the machines built by Watt is depicted on the Figure \ref{fig:Watt}.

This progressively leads to the implementation of the steam machines in Europe, and it was one of the most important elements of the Industrial Revolution. Indeed, aside the progressive replacement of the horses, wind and water mills also started to be replaced by mills powered by steam. At the beginning of the 19th, other fields like mining or merchandise transportation also started to utilize the steam machine technology as well.

In 1872, the American George Brayton (1830 - 1892) proposed the Brayton cycle as a ''reciprocating oil-burning engine'' \cite{Boles2006}. His engine consisted of a large cylinder where the compression, the combustion and, the expansion of the gas were successively performed. 

Nowadays, the Brayton cycle is used for gas turbines where the compression and expansion takes place in rotating machinery, also called turbomachine. Basically, the Brayton cycle is composed of three parts. 

First the compressor that will compress the ambient air to some pressure level. Then, there is a combustion chamber that will heat up the air to augment its level of energy. This heating-up is performed thanks to the injection of fuel into the combustion chamber. Finally, the resulting gas from the combustion is expanded into a turbine. The power produced by the expansion is partly consumed by the compressor while the rest is used to feed any kind of power receiver. The expanded gas is then released to the atmosphere. This cycle is depicted in the Figure \ref{fig:C1_GT} where the receiver is an electrical generator.

There exists many variants of the Brayton gas cycles. The one proposed above is the simplest one where the air goes through a compressor, a combustion chamber and a turbine before returning to the environment. 

Variants are Brayton cycle where heat exchangers are used to recover heat when it is possible, or cycles where the compression and the expansion can be split into multiple stages, etc.

All these variants have been thought to solve problems encounter and to enlarge the range of possible applications where the Brayton gas cycle can be used. For instance, Brayton cycle is used in aircraft for the propulsion, or are integrated within a power plant to produce electricity.\\

This work is focused on the improvement of a computer code made by the company MITIS SA which aims to assess the performance of a multiple configuration of the micro gas turbine characterized by small component. While some additions to the program are done to increase its modularity, the main improvements are ones that will allow the computer code to utilize experimental results to increase its accuracy. \\

Not all the possible improvements will be considered for this master thesis. The main concern will be on the turbomachine and how to simulate the influence of the operating conditions on their performances based on performance maps. These maps can be considered as the footprint of each turbomachine.  The purpose will be to be able to easily modify the program by switching from one map to another one. Also, the integration of performance maps will give the ability to see the impact of the rotational speed of the compressor and turbine on their respective behaviors.
